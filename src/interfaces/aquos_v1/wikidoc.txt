= aquos_v1 =
The aquos_v1 interface sends commands to an Sahrp Aquos TV (Non EU Models) by LAN. . This is a bi-directional interface, which means, that the interface can read information.
The interface supports several actions/commands, so codesets files are required. The interface does not support discover of of devices by uPnP.
THIS INTERFACE HAS NOT BEEN FINISHED AND NEVER BEEN TESTED, DUE TO A LACK OF AVAILABLE TEST DEVICE. SO IT LIKELY DONT WORK!

The following settings are supported by the interface
<div style="overflow:auto; ">
{| class="wikitable"
! align="left" | Setting
! align="left" | Description
|-
|Host
|Host-Name or IP-Address of your TV.
|-
|Port
|Port Address of your adb interfaces. Defaults is 4998
|-
|FNCodeset
|Filename of your codeset. Without path
|-
|TimeToClose
|Timeout in seconds, until the connection from the interface to the device will be close.
* -1 The connection will not be closed
* 0 The connection will be closed immediately
* all other, Timeout in seconds
|-
|DisableInterFaceOnError

|-
|DisconnectInterFaceOnSleep
|Disconnects the interface, when your remote control device goes to sleep
|}</div>

You need to define the codeset filename, which contains the command set for your device

A  codeset file could look like that (shortened version):

<div style="overflow-x: auto;"><syntaxhighlight  lang="xml">
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<codeset>
  <action name="power_toggle" >
      <action  type="alias" cmd="enablepower" />
      <action string="codeset" name="power_on" type="string" cmd="RCKY12  " />
  </action>
  <action string="codeset" name="left"                     type="string"  cmd="RCKY43  " />
  <action string="codeset" name="right"                    type="string"  cmd="RCKY44  " />
  <action string="codeset" name="up"                       type="string"  cmd="RCKY41  " />
  <action string="codeset" name="down"                     type="string"  cmd="RCKY42  " />
 </codeset>
</syntaxhighlight></div>
