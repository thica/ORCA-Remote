The IR On Android interface suports the integreted IR transmitter on Android devices. As all infrared based devices, it supports CCF based codesets
The ADB interface sends commands to an Android device using the adb interface by LAN. Control by USB cable is not supported. This is a bi-directional interface, which means, that the interface can read information.
The interface supports several actions/commands, so codesets files are required. The interface supports discover of of devices by uPnP.

The following settings are supported by the interface
<div style="overflow:auto; ">
{| class="wikitable"
! align="left" | Setting
! align="left" | Description
|-
|Host
|Host-Name or IP-Address of your android device. Could be "discover" as well. For "discover" you need to set the discover parameters of your Android device.
Could be "linked:interfacename:configname:parametername". In this case, the host/ip-address will be pulled from a different interface.
|-
|Port
|Port Address of your adb interfaces. Defaults is 5555
|-
|FNCodeset
|Filename of your codeset. Without path
|-
|DiscoverManufacturer
|For Autodiscover: The discover manufacturer of your device
|-
|DiscoverModels
|For Autodiscover: List of models which are accepted by discover. Seperated by commata
|-
|DiscoverPrettyName
|For Autodiscover: Pretty name of the device to discover
|-
|DiscoverServiceTypes
|For Autodiscover: Service Types to discover. Defaults to "urn:dial-multiscreen-org:service:dial:1"
|-
|DiscoverTimeOut
|For Autodiscover: Timeout to discover a device in seconds. Defaults to 5
|-
|SaveDiscoveredIP
|For Autodiscover: Flag if the discovered IP should be saved. Prevents to discover every app start.
|-
|OldDiscoveredIP
|For Autodiscover: The last discoverd IP-Address. Delete, if you want the force a new discover
|-
|TimeToClose
|Timeout in seconds, until the connection from the interface to the device will be close.
* -1 The connection will not be closed
* 0 The connection will be closed immediately
* all other, Timeout in seconds
|-
|DisableInterFaceOnError
|Disables the interface, if an error occurs. Prevents the interface to continue to send commands to a broken connection.
|-
|DisconnectInterFaceOnSleep
|Disconnects the interface, when your remote control device goes to sleep
|}</div>

Discover uses the upnp discover protocol. Pleaser refer to the discover upnp documentation for details on discover.

You need to define the codeset filename, which contains the command set for your device

A codeset file could look like that (shortened version):

<div style="overflow-x: auto;"><syntaxhighlight  lang="xml">
<?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>
<!-- Translates Orca Actions to Interface Commands action = Orca Action String -->
<codeset>
  <!-- KEYCODE_DPAD_CENTER /  enter=66-->
  <action string="codeset" name='ok' waitforresponse='0' cmd='Shell' params="input keyevent 23" />
  <!-- KEYCODE_DPAD_XXXX -->
  <action string="codeset" name='left' waitforresponse='0' cmd='Shell' params="input keyevent 21" />
</codeset>
</syntaxhighlight></div>

{| class="wikitable"
! align="left" | Attribute
! align="left" | Description
|-
|action
|Defines, to which ORCA action the  command should be send
|-
|getvar
|This defines, which information will be collected from the json respons., Only the last attribute will be used. If an attribute belongs to a list, only the first list entry is parsed.
|-
|ldestvar
|This defines, which variable should be set by the information parsed by getvar. This variable is local to the interface and local to the configuration
|-
|gdestvar
|This defines, which variable should be set by the information parsed by getvar. This variable is global to all ORCA functions
|-
|cmd
|This is the command to transmit using adb.
|}

Variable replacement: You can use variable placeholder to use variables in your adb command string

{| class="wikitable"
! align="left" | var
! align="left" | Description
|-
|var()
|Uses a global variable name to be replaced
|-
|lvar()
|Uses a language variable name to be replaced
|-
|cvar()
|Uses a local variable to be replaced
|}

You can have as much actions as you like in your codeset file. You can use the same codeset file for several configurations. You should have a "ping" command in your codeset
