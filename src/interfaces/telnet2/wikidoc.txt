Some word to discover:
The interface reduces matches / results from the discover results using the ...
* discoverprettyname
* discovermodels
* discovermanufacturer
... settings. Blank option will not be used. You could eg use the pretty name just to match a specific device, or just the manufacturer name to match all devices in the network of this manufacturer.
Discover uses the upnp discover protocol

You need to define the codeset filename, which contains the command set for your device
