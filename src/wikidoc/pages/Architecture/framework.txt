Orca is witten in [http://www.python.org/ Python]. Python is an interpreter language, so the sources will not be compiled.  You do not need a compiler and you do not need a developmnet environment. Using PyCharm as an IDE is helpful, but not mandantory. A simple text editir will do the job as well.

Orca is based on the [http://kivy.org/#home Kivy] framework. Kivy is a portable framework for developing mobile applications using python. Currently kivy is supporting the following Operating Systems:

* Windows
* Android
* Unix
* MacOSx
* IOS

Due to the lack of availability of any Apple devices. MacOSx and IOS is untested.
