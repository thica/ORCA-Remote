For those, how just wants to use a readymade remote control definition, you can select and download those using ORCA, and maybe you need to adjust some parameter in the settings dialog. No further knowledge required.
*Configurators:
For those, who wants more, you can adjust / change a given remote control definition or even can create a new remote control definition. You should know how to use / edit xml files and how to copy files to your remote device.  You do not to have programming skills for that.
