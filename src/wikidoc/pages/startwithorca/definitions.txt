WikiDoc:TOCTitle:8=Pre defined definitions

Orca has a set of pre defined definitions. A definition is a combination of screen layout, functions, interfaces, commands/codesets and settings.
You can a see a definition as a remote control. A definition can include further definitions to compile a set of remotes.
Usually you can configure some options within an definition, so if so, there is a section for each definition in the settings dialog of ORCA
There are some definitions, which don't work stand alone, their purpose is to get included as a functionality extension for other definitions. They usually ends with "_template in the name.

A special one is the "mediaplayer_wizard". This definition pushes settings in a definition called mediaplayer_settings and runs this definition.
There are a lot of templates available for the mediaplayer_wizard, so please have a look there to find further pre defined definitions

Below you see list of pre defined definitions
