Are you ready for ORCA?

=Ready?=

Think about, how you want to use ORCA. If you want to use the given remote control definitions, you will not need to have deeper IT knowledge. For some interfaces: you should know, what an IP address or host name is.

If you want to customize or create a remote control definition please be aware of the following topics:

As long as ORCA does not have a GUI designed and a configurator, you should be able to:

* read, understand and edit XML files
* possible understand image formats, and know how to detect image sizes
* Know, how to transfer files from your PC to your mobile device
* Have a advanced understanding of how communication between devices works, eg: if you are scared / struggle to record&convert IR commands from A to B, ORCA might not be the optimal solution for you.
* be patient enough, to design and optimize to device design based on XML descriptions

If you do not match these requirements, some other solutions may be better for you. A this stage , ORCA is not as simple as the Logitech Harmony Wizards (credits to them)

=Hardware requirements=

You should match the following hardware requirements to use ORCA

*A device you like to use as a remote :Android Tablet, Android phone, Windows Notebook, Linux Notebook, (Apple to be confirmed)
** Think about, if a phone with a 3 inch display is the right solution for you.
*Devices that can be controlled by your hardware: If you want control your TV by IR with a tablet computer, you will need an IPtoIR converter
*Optional: A PC for adjusting and testing your definition / layout

=How to start=
* Install ORCA on your target device
* Optional: Install ORCA on a PC
* On first start, ORCA will download required further files, so you need to be onlne with your device.
* Select on of the definitions shown in the setup page. It will be downloaded and started.
* You might need to adjust some parameters (IP Adresses / Host Names) of the used interfaces of your definition.

=If you want to customize=
* NEVER: Change Orca Files or original/3rd party definition files. THEY MAY BE REPLACED ON UPDATES!
* Read the Wiki, how to change the definition files
* YOU DO NOT NEED ANY DEVELOPMENT TOOLS TO CONFIGURE ORCA!
* A simple text editor to edit XML files is enough!
