* There is a increasing demand for Remote Control Capabilites for tablets and large screen phones.
* Current market solutions are limited:
** Requiere a web server
** Supports only limited interfaces
** Closed source and vendor specific
** Limited layout and design capabilities
** No support for macros / linked actions
* Orca is designed to overcome these limitations
* But: Unlimited options increases complexity. Ready made remote definitions are available, but to change / create remotes ORCA will target experienced IT users and integrators. Designers and wizards are planned for a second phase
